Timestamp to start (https://imgur.com/a/SDKU9eo) I am selling a basically brand new lian-Li Case PC-O5SX. The only thing not included are the original fans (I never used them and have since lost them) It comes with all the original hardware and the case/glass has no visible markings that I can find. I tried to make sure that I had all the viewpoints covered in the timestamp (the glass is hard to photograph). It will come in the original box with all the original packaging as well. I am lookin.

Pretty much i need to be able tu run full lenght gpu cards and to be able orient the case either in horizantal or vertical position. For now, only the cpu would be water cooled but im hoping to expand to gpu watercooling once the GTX 1080 comes out. I've seen that the swiftech h220x fits but those are kinda hard to come by these days and it seems the H220x2 wont even fit anymore. I'm in the planning stages of my build. I have some questions about which fan setup should I go with my case. I have a Lian Li PC-O5SX and I'm wondering how should I setup the fans on the radiator. As seen here ( the space where the radiator and fan goes, is used as an exhaust. Should the fans be position as push or pull towards the outside? I'm thinking of using a Black Ice Nemesis 240GTS and 2 EK Vardar F5 3000RPM. I'm gonna add a third fan behind the motherb.

So, if any of you remember my last thread, the GTX 1070 Ti Duke Edition didn't come close to fitting. So, I went ahead and purchased another case I had my eye on: the Lian Li PC-O5SX! And the Duke fit very nicely inside. That being said, does anyone want a Sentry?
